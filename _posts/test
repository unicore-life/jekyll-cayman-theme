## Decomission of GALERA cluster at TASK and enable access to TRYTON via UNICORE

With end of October 2017, [Galera cluster][task-galera] at TASK is beeing decomissioned. 
As of now, all of [PLGrid][plgrid] users may use [Tryton cluster][task-tryton] instead.

UNICORE users should now see entry TASK-TRYTON in UNICORE registry which allows seemless access to TASK site.
Site TASK-GALERAPLUS is no longer available and all UNICORE services allowing access to [Galera cluster][task-galera] 
have been disabled.

UNICORE site TASK-TRYTON has been deployed with version 7.8.0, latest release of UNICORE at the moment. 
Batch system is now based on [Slurm][slurm] and is fully configured with [Unity IDM][unity] as an attributes source. 
Also, as of now, site is available in [UNICORE Portal][unicore-portal].

Any feedback will be appreciated, so feel free to contact as via [PLGrid portal][plg-portal].

Many computing hours near Baltic sea accessed via UNICORE:)
