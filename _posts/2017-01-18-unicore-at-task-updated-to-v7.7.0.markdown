## UNICORE components updated to v7.7.0 at TASK (PLGrid)

UNICORE components at [TASK][task] site have been updated to latest version 7.7.0 in [PLGrid][plgrid].
Along with the update, site has been switched from deprecated UVOS attributes source into [Unity IDM][unity] attributes 
source - current central compoment responsible for passing user data needed by UNICORE security model.

Like usual, everything should work like before, so it is transparent for the users (despite the downtime which occurred during the update).

By the way, happy new year with UNICORE for everyone:)
