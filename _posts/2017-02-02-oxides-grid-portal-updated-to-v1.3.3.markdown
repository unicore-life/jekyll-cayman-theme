[Oxides Grid Portal][oxides-grid-portal] has been just updated to version 1.3.3 at [PLGrid][plgrid]. 
It fixes welcome page, which no longer uses Google APIs for reading feeds (it is not supported anymore). 

The release contains also [Spring Boot][spring-boot] framework update to version 1.5.1.RELEASE.
Parsing feeds is now moved to backend, so browser will get pure JSON now.

Enjoy!
