## PLGrid updated UNICORE Portal to v2.2.0

Starting from now, [PLGrid][plgrid] and [ICM][icm] users are using latest version 2.2.0 of UNICORE Portal. 
Change log may be read [here](https://www.unicore.eu/changes/portal). 
Users may also finally forget about **/portal** context path at the end of URL address. 
Now, it is enough just to put **unicore-portal.grid.icm.edu.pl** in browser.

Happy browsing ;)
